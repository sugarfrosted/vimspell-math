# vimspell-math
Just a wordlist generated dictionary of math terms. If you notice any mathematical words missing when spell checking, just add them to the word list. I'm trying to keep the names of people separate from the other words, (just to make verification easier.) But other than that I'd prefer them alphabetical.

These are mostly just words I've come across in my homework, (I'm more algebra and logic) and while proofreading an applied math journal, so tons are likely missing.

Feel free to remake the spell list using the mkspell command of vim (see `:help mkspell` for more information.)
